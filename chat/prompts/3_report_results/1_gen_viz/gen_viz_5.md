## Task: `gen_viz_5` (terminal_claude_agent)

<research_methodology>
Create figures that belong in a top-venue paper.

- Every figure needs a clear takeaway visible at a glance.
- Choose chart types that match the data relationship (comparisons, trends, correlations, distributions).
- Include uncertainty (error bars, confidence intervals) when showing experimental results.
- Keep it clean — no clutter, clear labels with units, readable at print size.
</research_methodology>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_CbJDs3opF7E_/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_5`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_CbJDs3opF7E_/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_5/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_CbJDs3opF7E_/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_5/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_CbJDs3opF7E_/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_5/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>

<task>
Render a publication-quality DATA figure for a top-tier venue research paper.

This figure plots numbers, so it is RENDERED from those numbers — not drawn by an image model. Use the aii-data-fig-gen skill. The output is deterministic: run it once, look at it, fix the spec if the data or labels are wrong, run it again.

STEPS:
1. Read the skill: `.claude/skills/aii-data-fig-gen/SKILL.md`.
2. Pick the chart type that fits the specification below. `python <skill>/scripts/chart_gen.py --list-types` lists them; `--example <type>` prints a complete spec to copy.
3. Write your spec to `fig5_spec.json` in your workspace. Put EVERY numeric value from the specification into it — the spec is the figure.
4. Render it:
   `python <skill>/scripts/chart_gen.py --spec fig5_spec.json --out fig5_v0`
   That writes `fig5_v0.pdf` (the deliverable, vector) and `fig5_v0.png` (for you to look at).
5. READ THE PNG BACK and check it against the checklist below.
6. If anything is wrong, edit the spec and re-render. Repeat until clean — this is cheap and deterministic, so there is no attempt limit and no reason to accept a flawed figure.

DELIVERABLE: `fig5_v0.pdf` in your workspace root. Leave `fig5_spec.json` there too — it is the figure's source, and the step files it next to the figure so the figure stays reproducible.

Verification checklist (after EVERY render) — these are the things only you can check, because they are about whether the figure says what you meant:
- Every number in the figure matches the specification — no invented or dropped values
- Axis labels state what is measured AND its units
- Axis ranges make the comparison readable rather than flattening it
- The chart type still makes the point once you can see it drawn
- The caption describes what is actually drawn

The generator already REFUSES the rest rather than shipping them, so a figure you can read back cannot have them: overlapping or cut-off labels, a legend covering the data, a series drawn without a name beside named ones, two series a reader cannot tell apart, and a fit or a scale that the data cannot support. When it exits non-zero the message names the exact key, index or label and what to change — do that rather than re-rolling.

Reach for a generator first, and hand-write only if none fits. Every type in `--list-types` already carries the house style, the data-integrity checks and the layout fixes, so using one is less work than plotting by hand and the result matches every other figure in the paper.

If nothing in the catalogue fits, writing matplotlib yourself is expected and supported — novel figures exist. When you do, import the house style AND its layout passes so the figure still belongs to the set — `apply_house_style`, `place_legend`, `place_point_label`, `fit_legends`, `clear_legends_of_data`, `fit_tick_labels`, `fit_titles`, `rasterize_dense_clouds`, `assert_legends_clear_of_data`, `assert_series_are_distinguishable`, `assert_axis_names_are_unique` from `chart_style`, and `fit_point_labels` + `assert_text_is_legible` from `chart_geometry`, the last of which raises if any label ends up printed over another or cut off at the edge. Build legends with `place_legend` and point names with `place_point_label` — a legend made with a bare `ax.legend` cannot be reflowed when it turns out too wide, and a name written with a bare `ax.annotate` will not be moved off the marker it landed on. The "Use a generator when one fits" section of SKILL.md has the exact snippet and the order to call them in. What you lose is the automatic checking that the picture agrees with the numbers, so verify every value yourself against the specification.

Figure ID: fig5
Title: The axis reads canned refusals, not all refusals
Caption: Axis-A detection AUROC under regex versus semantic labels, and split by refusal wording. Swapping the label barely moves the pooled value ($-0.013$ paired), but the axis separates canonically-worded refusals at 0.897 and the genuine refusals the regex misses at only 0.611 -- inside the members' own random-direction reading band, whose upper edge averages 0.750. The verdict is \texttt{READS\_CANONICAL\_WORDING\_ONLY}.
Data and chart description: Vertical bar chart with 95% confidence-interval error bars, four bars. X-axis categories, left to right: 'pooled, regex label' (grey-blue), 'pooled, semantic label' (blue), 'canonically-worded refusals' (green), 'REFUSAL_NONCANONICAL (regex misses)' (red). Values with intervals: 0.834 [0.736, 0.923]; 0.821 [0.752, 0.866]; 0.897 [0.864, 0.922]; 0.611 [0.542, 0.686]. Y-axis 'axis-A detection AUROC', range 0.45 to 1.00. Draw TWO horizontal reference lines spanning the plot: a dashed grey line at 0.500 labelled 'textbook chance', and a solid orange line at 0.750 labelled 'measured random-direction reading band, mean upper edge'. Annotate the gap between the two pooled bars with 'paired delta -0.013 [-0.067, +0.030]'. Sans-serif, white background, light horizontal gridlines.
Aspect Ratio: 4:3
Summary: Bar chart showing the refusal axis reads canonically-worded refusals well and non-canonical ones no better than a random direction.

```
qwen3 on huggingface has base model also official safety finetuned version and there is a community finetuned uncensored model called abliterated. take these models and do a mech interp analysis of how they differ in activation. also find some patterns in internal computation on safety prompts. and possibly create a new metric for safety. so that for any random model on huggingface you would not need to run the full benchmarks, but only this metric on 0- to few prompts and get a safety evaluation
```
