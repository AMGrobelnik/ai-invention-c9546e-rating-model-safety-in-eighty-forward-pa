## Layman Summary

Re-tests the paper's key claim by scoring its refusal directions on text the models actually wrote, instead of on eight hand-written sentences that every direction got a perfect score on.

## Full Summary

EVALUATION of the iteration-2 lexicality verdict, run as pure re-analysis of archived artifacts plus a forward-pass-only re-encode of already-logged text (no sampling, no new steered generation, no training). Six Qwen3 checkpoints (0.6B/1.7B x base/instruct/abliterated), pinned to the archived revision SHAs, bf16, one RTX A4500. OpenRouter spend $0.19 of a $1.50 cap. Pre-registration stamped BEFORE any AUROC (results/prereg_eval.json, 3 amendments each with when_decided).

CRITICAL PRE-FLIGHT: axis vectors are not stored on disk, so all axes (A canned / B token-disjoint paraphrase / C norm-matched stylistic / D random / E prompt-contrast) were re-derived by re-running the archived fit code. V2 gate = STRICT_FAIL_SUBSTANTIVE_PASS: worst deviation from the archived summary statistics is 5.3e-3 relative (pre-registered gate 1e-3), while re-derivation is bit-exact WITHIN this run (self-delta 0.0), so the residual is a cross-run device difference (archive: RTX 4000 Ada; here: A4500), and the re-derived canned axis has cosine 0.9992 with an independently fitted float32 axis from the breadth panel. Random axes reproduce exactly from their stored seeds.

HEADLINE, NOT ANTICIPATED BY THE BINARY RULE: the archived 'held-out AUROC 1.000' certificate over-stated axis A as well as axis B. On 7,241 re-encoded, AB-blind, model-generated items (stratum-centred projections, first-generated-token position, prompt-clustered bootstrap, n=2000), the canned axis A reaches only AUROC 0.486-0.790 -- CI excludes chance on 4 of 6 checkpoints, clears the whole [0.40,0.60] band on 1 (instruct_1p7), and sits AT CHANCE on both abliterated members. Axis B spans 0.386-0.602. Pre-registered lexicality verdict = MIXED (2/6 have upper CI(A-B) <= 0.10; 2/6 have A-B > 0.10 with CI excluding 0). Holm-adjusted p: instruct_0p6 and instruct_1p7 0.003, rest >= 0.10. Weak-estimate hypothesis directly falsified: R^2(s_B on s_A) <= 0.036 and the residual AUROC stays near chance, so B is not a scaled noisy copy of A. The stylistic control is not merely at chance -- on 4 checkpoints its CI lies entirely BELOW 0.5 (refusals score LOW on formal register) while it still induces 0.00 refusal when steered.

MATCHED-CONTRAST (the reviewer's decisive quantity): steering convention extracted from the archived hook (h_L += alpha*NORM_L*x_hat), so c = alpha*NORM_L/raw_norm_X. A crosses 50% refusal at 0.91-1.57 contrast units; B is driven to 14.2-16.3 contrast units and tops out at 0.07-0.30. At MATCHED contrast units A stays above B by +0.36 to +0.61 with CIs excluding 0 on 6/6 -> NORM_MISMATCH_DOES_NOT_EXPLAIN. Every axis shows an inverted U; B's ceiling is not explained by fluency collapse on 5/6.

SEMANTIC SCORING: re-scored with the repaired four-class judge, B crosses 0.5 on every checkpoint (PARTIAL_REVERSAL_UNDER_SEMANTIC_SCORING) -- but the clean controls (C, D), which induce 0.00 refusal under the regex, themselves draw judge REFUSAL rates up to 0.80, and a five-class rubric with an explicit non-canonical-refusal class puts most of B's high-alpha text in DEGENERATE (mean 0.711 vs 0.285 refusal of any wording; A: 0.667 refusal / 0.333 degenerate). Adjudicated verdict: REVERSAL_CONFOUNDED_BY_DEGENERACY. Judge sensitivity 0.688 / specificity 0.804 for REFUSAL against the blind-adjudicated audit truth; attenuation-corrected column ships alongside.

GATES: V1 leakage 0 overlapping items on all six; V3 re-encoded refusal-logit margin reproduces the archived r_t_first at Pearson >= 0.9975 (fixed by concatenating token IDS rather than strings -- string concatenation let BPE merge across the prompt/completion boundary on up to 450/1028 plain-rendered base items); V4 all six powered (>= 40/class); V5 Holm; V7 accounting: 33,135 scanned -> 27,758 kept -> 7,241 re-encoded; V8 provenance map of 71 numbers with an EXECUTED assertion that no number in the deliverable prose is untraceable.
