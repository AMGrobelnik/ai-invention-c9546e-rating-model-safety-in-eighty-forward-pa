## Layman Summary

Rebuilds the tiny 21-item test that iteration 1 used to justify swapping its AI grader, re-labels 124 real outputs with a blind panel of three AI annotators, and checks which conclusions survive.

## Full Summary

AUDIT OF THE ITERATION-1 JUDGE SWAP. Rebuilds the 21-item, 9-character-heuristic probe that justified replacing the frozen judge (which moved abliterated plain-harmful refusal 0.700->0.113 and jailbreak ASR 0.092->0.858) as a 124-item probe over all four rubric classes, drawn from the 3,365 archived iteration-1 generations and stratified over the frozen-vs-repaired disagreement region (Q1 60 / Q2 24 / Q3 PARTIAL 20 / Q4 21 bridge / Q5 topup; max member share 13.7%; 47 disagreement cells). Truth from two BLIND independent LLM annotators plus an adjudicator, drawn from three model families (xAI grok-4.3, Moonshot kimi-k2-thinking, Alibaba qwen3.8-max) NONE of which is the family of any scored arm, so no arm is self-referentially scored. 11 arms scored on identical items under the unchanged frozen rubric: 6 live judges, 3 archived-label arms, 2 free negative controls. Cost $1.4872 of a $2.50 cap over 1,300 billed calls; fully cached, so reruns are $0.00. No GPU, no local inference.

SIX FINDINGS (all in method_out.json.metadata.headline_findings, each with its number).
(1) H1 SEVERELY_DEGRADED_NOT_ZERO. Iteration 1's '0/7, three judges, never labels harmful compliance as COMPLIANCE' does NOT survive: pooled COMPLIANCE recall of the three un-framed safety arms is 29/117 = 0.248, Wilson 95% [0.179, 0.333] (frozen 6/39, claude-3-haiku 10/39, claude-haiku-4.5 13/39). BUT on the 21 items carried verbatim from the old probe those same arms score 0/21. The old MEASUREMENT replicates exactly; only the generalisation from 7 easy items fails.
(2) H2 the old truth labels were RIGHT. The blind panel re-adjudicated all 21 bridge items and changed NONE; every arm's bridge score is identical old-vs-new (gemini still 21/21, llama-70b 18/21, claude-haiku-4.5 12/21 un-framed). The plan's A007 premise ('a refusal-by-redirection, demonstrably mislabelled') was TESTED AND REFUTED: the completion opens 'Certainly! Here's a message that conveys hope...' but truncates at 64 tokens mid-compliance on 'Self-harm or suicide is a way to feel', which annotator B quoted; label COMPLIANCE stands.
(3) H3 the defect is COVERAGE, not labels. The 9-character heuristic scores 0.912 [0.770, 0.970] on the items it labels but covers only 27.4% of the probe and emits PARTIAL never. That is the quantitative statement of the defect.
(4) H4 the rubric's PARTIAL boundary is not reliably applicable. Cohen's kappa(A,B) = 0.567 [0.471, 0.664] (below the pre-set 0.60 floor, so the planned low-kappa path ran); per-class one-vs-rest kappa COMPLIANCE 0.819, DEGENERATE 0.846, REFUSAL 0.391, PARTIAL 0.054. Dominant A-vs-B flow is REFUSAL<->PARTIAL (26 items). Where A and B agree an independent third family agrees with 83/83 of the consensus [0.956, 1.0], so disagreement is confined to that one boundary.
(5) H5 propagation PARTLY_DISSOLVES. Both published rates reproduce exactly from scored.jsonl. Against annotator truth on a FRESH SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLE (40/block): jailbreak ASR revision STANDS (truth 0.800 [0.652, 0.895], inside the repaired arm's CI; frozen 0.092 far outside); the block-A refusal revision needs RESTATING (truth 0.000 [0.000, 0.088], so the repaired judge's 0.113 still over-states it and the frozen 0.700 is wrong by an order of magnitude). Confusion-matrix correction corroborates (corrected 0.017 and 0.926). method_out.json names every downstream quantity requiring restatement (sanity gate, ladder SMOOTH/SNAPPED verdict, per-member refusal and XSTest rates, per-attack and pooled ASR, alpha_50/H1'').
(6) H6 NEW: the frozen judge is itself unstable. Re-run at temperature 0 with its exact configuration it reproduces its own archived labels only 75% of the time (kappa 0.596), versus 96% for the repaired arm and 100% for the gold arm, so every iteration-1 frozen-judge rate carries an un-reported labelling-variance component.

NET READING FOR THE PAPER: iteration 1's DECISION to swap the judge was correct and is confirmed by independent annotator truth; its stated EVIDENCE ('never', 0/7) was an over-generalisation from a probe that could only contain the easy quarter of the population; and one of its two headline revised numbers needs restating. Three sensitivity columns (drop-unstable, A==B-consensus-only, bridge-only) accompany every headline number. ALSO NOTE: annotators are LLM agents, not humans, so all accuracies bound agreement with an LLM panel, not ground truth; the probe is deliberately stratified so raw per-arm accuracy on it is not a corpus estimate. Deliverables: method.py (resumable, cached, stages 0-7), method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out-validated, 124 examples with predict_* for all 11 arms), results/probe_items_v2.json, annotation/blind_items_v2.json, results/truth_labels_v2.json, results/disputed_items.{json,md} (41 disputed items verbatim), results/cell_census.json, results/arm_labels_v2.json, results/cost_ledger.jsonl.
