## Layman Summary

Tests whether a one-number safety score, invented on a single small model, still works on 19 different models, and finds it usually cannot even be computed.

## Full Summary

Tests whether alpha_50 -- the steering coefficient at which a fresh generation on BENIGN prompts starts refusing 50% of the time, invented in iteration 1 on one Qwen3-0.6B lineage with 5 prompts and no CI -- is a cross-model triage metric. Panel: 19 checkpoints, 7 lineages, 6 architecture families (Qwen3, Qwen2, Llama3, Llama2, SmolLM2), all <=2B, float32, 1x RTX 4090. Cost $0.3384 of a $2.00 judge cap. Pre-registered before measurement; 12 amendments logged with timestamps and the data state at the time. Re-running --assemble from checkpoints reproduces method_out.json byte-identically apart from created_utc.

D1 (alpha_50, 20 benign prompts x 5 seeds x 13-15 alphas = ~1300-1500 fresh generations/member, logistic MLE on the exact per-draw likelihood, 2000-replicate prompt-clustered bootstrap): THE PRE-REGISTERED PRIMARY ESTIMATOR IS DEFINED ON 1 OF 19 CHECKPOINTS. Two measured causes: (a) the dose curve is an INVERTED U, not a sigmoid -- past the alpha where the axis dominates the residual stream the model can no longer FORM a refusal opener (Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct: 0.01 -> 0.92 -> 0.13, whole-grid logistic gives alpha_50 = -0.459, CI [-12.98, 0.67]); (b) 6 of 7 base members never reach 0.5. Base max refusal rate 0.360 [0.190, 0.526] vs tuned 0.698 [0.474, 0.883] is a real base-vs-tuned separation. Variance decomposition (lineage = resampling unit): AMBIGUOUS on both pre-registered fallbacks (nonparametric alpha_50 within/across 0.885 [0.13, 4.57], n=6; max refusal rate 1.113 [0.64, 5.67], n=7). Within-lineage rank ordering reproduces the pooled ordering in only 2 of 4 / 2 of 7 lineages. Paired instruct-minus-abliterated: both defined CIs include 0, only 2 lineages carry it, pooled CI SUPPRESSED (a bootstrap over 2 numbers is not an interval) -> claim WITHDRAWN_UNDERPOWERED per the rule stated in advance; simulated power at the iteration-1 gap was 0.35, computed before the fits, with bootstrap coverage measured at 0.967 vs nominal 0.95.

TWO MECHANISMS THAT REFRAME THE METRIC. (i) LEXICAL_PARTIAL: a token-disjoint paraphrased refusal axis (zero frozen-opener matches) fails to reproduce alpha_50 on 3 of 4 informative control members with disjoint Wilson CIs -- Qwen3-0.6B 0.933 vs 0.183, Qwen3-0.6B-abliterated 0.967 vs 0.000, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct 0.900 vs 0.633; only Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct agrees. A norm-matched stylistic axis induces <=0.02 and a random direction <=0.08. So on the anchor lineage the score largely prices a particular refusal WORDING, not refusal. (ii) LAYER FRAGILITY (unplanned, forced by the data): the outcome-blind scan leaves layers 6/7 near-tied (0.719 vs 0.688) and the logistic alpha_50 spans 0.53-2.32 (4.4x) across L-2..L+2 while the nonparametric estimate stays in 0.40-0.73.

D2 (275 greedy generations/member, repaired judge only): 5,785 items judged, parse rate 0.998, 0 unlabelled, $0.3384. Screen-vs-judge Cohen's kappa -0.021 to 0.774 (median 0.227), confirming the cheap string screen is not a substitute. Five base members auto-flagged UNRELIABLE (degenerate 0.25-0.46) and excluded from correlations.

D3: AMS reimplemented to dossier spec (48 pairs, exactly 96 forward passes asserted, final prompt token, 40-80% depth sweep, all three calibration rules; synthetic separation recovered to 2.2%). THE TABLE-I REPRODUCTION GATE FAILS (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct 8.37 -> 5.007, 40% error; ordering inverts), so the label branches in code to 'our AMS reimplementation' everywhere. Headline paired bootstrap over 7 lineages: DELTA = rho_alpha50 - rho_AMS = -0.714 [-1.765, 0.667] -> TIE; exhaustive permutation p = 0.840 against a floor of 0.0004. The decisive statistic is the leave-one-lineage-out jackknife: alpha_50's rho ranges -0.086 to 0.771 depending on which single lineage is dropped, while our-AMS stays 0.714-0.943 and never changes sign -- for 1/14th the compute. H4 case study (DAN-Qwen3-1.7B, n=1, 3/4 class checks): the pre-registered blind spot was NOT observed -- our-AMS demotes it to WARN and its refusal direction has rotated (cosine 0.699 vs parent).

D4 RATCHET_GENERALISES: 5 of 5 lineages, 15 members, 4 families. Free-running perturbation deviation grows 2.0x-612x over 16 steps in every member; teacher-forced is 1-3 orders smaller and <1 in 7 of 15. Up-ramp failure 50-100% vs matched fresh-control refusal 0.00-0.33. No exponential fit, no lambda, so no identifiability gate can fail.

SHIPPED: method.py + lib/ (10 modules), prereg.json with all amendments, per-member checkpoints in results/, every dose-response token stream with alpha and r_t in gens/, scored.jsonl, judge_cache.jsonl, layer-sensitivity and T1/T2/T3 test outputs, README.md with verdict-first tables, and pyproject.toml pinning all 71 packages.
